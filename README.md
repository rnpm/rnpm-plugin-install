# Dear friends,

Last November me ([@Kureev](https://github.com/Kureev)) and Mike ([@grabbou](https://github.com/grabbou)) started RNPM. We aimed to bring you a better developer experience and bridge the tooling gap we had back then. Now, as you may know, RNPM is merged into [React Native core](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). It means that from now on you don't need to install a third-party software to use your favorite linking functionality (just use a react-native cli). We'd like to say a big "Thank you!" to everybody who supported us, filed new issues, composed PRs and helped us to review them.

Now, when RNPM is a part of React Native, we're going to seal this repository and keep working on React Native tooling inside the core. That said, I kindly ask you to file all new issues / prs in react-native repo and cc us. This repo (and other rnpm plugins) will be a available for a few more months in a read-only mode.

With love, 
Alexey Kureev and Micha≈Ç Grabowski
